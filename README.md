This project is the final submission for the Algorithm and Data Structures Laboratory. It serves as a practical implementation of fundamental concepts, featuring a Restaurant Ordering System.
The system allows users to manage restaurant orders, simulating the core logic of a digital restaurant management system through efficient data manipulation and structural organization in a terminal-based environment.
